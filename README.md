I wandered around the library for too long, found this book on herbs, and translated a spread about chamomile into [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jennlikespie123/book/blob/master/camomile.html).

[Here](https://github.com/jennlikespie123/Device-Agnostic/blob/master/fsdgfgnmbhgf.jpg?raw=true) are the originals!
