The name chamomile is sometimes confusing, covering several different plants, all with similar qualities, including the mayweeds (<i>Anthemis cotula</i>), feverfews (<i>Chrysanthemum parthenium</i>), and other varieties and hybrids in the <i>Anthemis</i> genus. They all have scented foliage and pretty white daisy flowers with yellow eyes. <i>Anthemis nobilis</i> is sometimes called Roman chamomile, and the plant has certainly been in use for centuries. The leaves are finely dissected and the stem is procumbent. It is found in dry fields and around cultivated areas. Today chamomile is probably the most widely used plant for herbal tea, but it is also used in liqueurs and wines. </section><section class="indented">The non-flowering variety of chamomile, called 'Treneagur', is low-growing and used to make a scented alternative to grass lawns.</section></section> <section class="smallpic"><img class="tumblr" src="https://image.ibb.co/dzrGu7/a73758aaede12d75bb85ec7c4c6a406e_1.jpg" alt="a73758aaede12d75bb85ec7c4c6a406e_1" border="0"></section></section><section class="words two"><section class="secondsection"><section>It will withstand a certain amount of crushing and an be walked upon. In medieval times, banks and seats were planted with chamomile and thyme to make fragrant garden benches The benches were designed to be sat upon and crushed, so the scent would be released. The flowering chamomiles, both single and double types, make a pretty addition to a mixed flower border or herb garden, and the bright, cheerful flowers are in bloom for a long period during the year. To successfully grow chamomile, plant it on light, sandy soil in a sunny position. The non-flowering types can only be propagated from cuttings, while the oters can be grown from seed.</section><section class="indented">The German, or wild, chamomile, <i>Matricaria chamomilla</i>, is native to southern Europe, but is also cultivated. It has scented flowers, however, the leaves are scentless. This plant is an annual and is grown mainly for its flower production to use as a tisane. Infusions are generally made using the dried flower heads which store well, so are always at hand. It is similar to Roman chamomile in appearance, and its round, hollow stem may be either procumbent or upright.</section><section class="indented">The word "chamomile" is derived from a Greek word meaning "apple", and the leaves do smell similar to green apples. The antiseptic qualities of the leaves were once put to use asinsect repellents and clothes fresheners. The blue oil, which was obtained from the plant, was added to baths to soothe and refreshen the skin and to lotions to bathe inflamed and sore skin. The oil is still said today to be a helpful topical pain reliever, benefiting sensitive, dry and delicate skins. A hair rinse made from chamomile has the properties of lightening and brightening blonde hair over a period of use. Chamomile is often an ingredient in commercial herbal shampoos. To enjoy the relaxing effect of chamomile, use the herb in little bags for the bath.</section></section></section>

<section>Chamomile tea is claimed to relax and to sooth digestion, but it should never be drunk to excess. Chamomile tea is a natural blood thinner, so consuming too much of chamomile tea can lead to negative results. To make the tea, infuse a spoonful of dried chamomile flowers in a teapot of boiling water. After a few minutes, strain the liquid into a cup, to which can be added a slice of lemon, if desired, or a spoonful of clear honey to sweeten the drink. Drink the tea after a meal as a digestive or at night to relax and encourage sleep.</section><section class="indented">For a gift idea, you may like to put dried chamomile flowers in a pretty box and label it, explaining how to make the tea.</section></section>
