They all have scented foliage and pretty white daisy flowers with yellow eyes. <i>Anthemis nobilis</i> is sometimes called Roman camomile, and the plant has certainly been in use for centuries.

The non-flowering types can only be propagated from cuttings, while the oters can be grown from seed.</section><section class="indented">The German, or wild, camomile, <i>Matricaria chamomilla</i>, is native to southern Europe, but is also cultivated. It has scented flowers, however, the leaves are scentless. This plant is an annual and is grown mainly for its flower production to use as a tisane.
